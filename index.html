  <title>Food Deserts in Washington D.C.</title>

<h1>How Gentrification Affects Food Availabilty in D.C.</h1>
<body>
<p>The data set I choose shows the amount of Grocery Stores in the Washington D.C. area. I choose this because of multiple reasons, D.C. is one of the most gentrified cities in the United States where the Western quadrants have significantly more resources than Eastern quadrants. Growing up in the area and having my parents grow up in D.C. when it was the murder capital of the country there has been a lot of change in the city. Growing up with my Grandmother, having access to a grocery store was very important as she, like 40% of other households in the district, did not have access to a vehicle.  A food desert is defined as an area that has a larger than one mile distance to a food market and does not own a car.(Food Empowerment Project) With D.C. being 68 square miles with much of it being non residential land it is hard to think that having the highest GDP per capita in the U.S. would have this problem.</p>

<p>The wards in D.C. are separated fairly equally by population and are redrawn every 10 years. Each ward holds between 84,000 and 90,000 people so in theory there should be an equal amount of resources per district. However, Ward 7 and Ward 8 which both hold just over 85,000 people each have significantly higher black populations. Ward 8 has a total population of 85,246 people with a black population of 70,959 and Ward 7 has a population of 85,685 people with 81,893 of them identifying as Black. This gives Ward 8 an 83.2% Black population and Ward 7 a huge 95.5% Black population. Both of these Wards only have 4 grocery stores each. In comparison to Wards 2,3, and 1 which have the highest number of stores with 17, 16, and 14 respectively the populations remain similar but the racial make up is vastly different. Ward 2 has a Black population of 11.3%, Ward 3 has 7.2%, and Ward 1 has 22%. In a city that used to be known as “Chocolate City” because of the large population of Black residents, the actions of mayor Muriel Bowser has accelerated the segregation of the city bringing in more wealth which has consequently pushed lower income residents into the suburbs of Maryland where housing is minorly cheaper. </p>

<p>Access to organic food is very crucial to the wealth and health of the citizens of the area. When families are eating cheaper, unhealthy foods they are more likely to be exposed to obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Many companies face fear of building stores in lower income areas because of the poverty levels. Many stores believe that there are lower profit margins, higher risk of crime, and less daytime foot traffic that brings in more customers. I spoke to D.C. native Donna Lee about how she feels that gentrification has affected the D.C. area. Her main concern when she was told about the data I found was that these organic markets are often out of the price range of the people in the area. “You can’t go to the grocery store and not spend $50 and you look at your basket and there are only 5 items”. In Ward 8 one of the four markets is a Whole Foods which does provide a large array of organic foods. However, Whole Foods is also the most expensive market in the DMV area where in Fox 5 news’ article on how expensive Thanksgiving food is at each popular market Whole Foods ranked the highest with a turkey being $29.88.(Fox 5) In comparison, cheaper options like Target and Walmart rank at $9.48 and $11.88 respectively. When citizens are already facing higher cost of living as DC ranks third in the country, providing expensive organic options in low-income areas is counter intuitive to the issue. With the median household income of Ward 8 being $45,598 which is only 46% of the city’s average of $98,916 it shows how companies are deliberately avoiding these areas in favor of the higher income areas.(DC Health)</p>

<p> 
The findings of this research shows that people in lower income areas of D.C. are prone to being avoided by supermarkets because of the poverty that exists. The organic markets being built in these areas also prices out many of the residents there. As 51% of Ward 8 belongs in a food desert there is an isolation of access to healthy foods in minority dominated neighborhoods. These actions directly disadvantage the members of this population and is a cause of why these areas are performing worse in many statistics. The building of these markets also creates an issue where the people of the area cannot afford the markets that are being built which causes them to buy groceries at corner stores which have significantly worse products that affect the health and lifespan of people in the area.
